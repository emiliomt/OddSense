This is an NFL prediction markets explorer built with Streamlit that integrates with the Kalshi betting API and OpenAI for AI-powered market insights. The application displays markets in a hierarchical structure matching Kalshi's UI, with automatic categorization, team name normalization, and AI-generated analysis powered by GPT-5.

# Recent Changes (November 5, 2025)

## Latest Update: Enhanced Event Context and Historical Data
- **Market Overview Dashboard** - Added metric cards with explanations for 24h volume, open interest, and time remaining
- **Historical Price Charts** - Hourly price movement visualization with trend indicators (📈 Rising, 📉 Falling, ➡️ Stable)
- **Volume History** - Collapsible chart showing trading volume spikes over time
- **Order Book Display** - Real-time pending YES and NO orders with explanatory context
- **Market Mechanics Guide** - Info boxes explaining bid/ask pricing, implied probability, and trading concepts
- **Human-Readable Time Display** - Shows "Market closes in X days/hours" instead of raw timestamps
- **Comprehensive Descriptions** - All metrics include help tooltips and plain-language explanations
- **New API Methods** - Added `get_market_candlesticks()` and `get_market_orderbook()` to KalshiService
- **Graceful Degradation** - Missing historical data shows helpful info messages instead of errors

## Fixed AI Market Brief Generation
- **Resolved empty content issue** - AI briefs now generate successfully
- **Root cause**: GPT-5 reasoning tokens consumed entire 500-token budget, leaving zero for output
- **Solution**: Increased `max_completion_tokens` to 5000 and added `reasoning_effort="low"`
- **Added debug logging** - Tracks finish_reason, refusal, and usage stats for troubleshooting
- **Enhanced error handling** - Specific messages for refusals, token limits, and empty responses

## Combined Market Pairs
- **Markets now combine paired contracts** - Each game shows as a single row with both teams
- Display format: Shows both teams with their probabilities (e.g., "SEA: 45% | WAS: 55%")
- **Reduced market count by half** - ~13 games instead of ~25 individual contracts
- Detail page allows selecting which team's contract to view via radio buttons
- Session state properly manages navigation between combined markets

## Game Contracts Only
- **Switched to Professional Football Game series filtering** using `series_ticker=KXNFLGAME`
- App now displays **only standalone game outcome contracts**
- Each market represents one team winning a specific game (e.g., "Seattle at Washington Winner?")
- **Removed multivariate/parlay markets** from the display
- Clean, simple market names without comma-separated conditions

## Market Display Reorganization
- Implemented **normalization layer** that transforms raw Kalshi API data into display-ready format
- Markets now grouped by **high-level categories** (Games, Passing Yards, Rushing Yards, Anytime Touchdowns, etc.)
- Within each category, markets are **grouped by game matchup** (e.g., "Minnesota Vikings @ Los Angeles Chargers")
- Display names show **intuitive titles** instead of contract IDs
- **Fixed probability calculation** to use yes_bid → last_price → mid_price fallback chain
- **Fixed volume display** to use correct API field (volume > volume_24h > liquidity)
- **Team abbreviation expansion** replaces "Los Angeles C" with "Los Angeles Chargers" etc.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses **Streamlit** as the web framework, providing a Python-based UI with built-in state management and reactive components. The interface follows a multi-page pattern with:
- A market listing page with hierarchical grouping (Category → Matchup → Combined Markets)
- Each row shows both teams with their probabilities in one combined view
- Search and pagination functionality
- Detail view with team selection radio buttons to view either team's contract
- Session state management for navigation between combined/single markets

**Pros**: Fast development, Python-native, built-in caching
**Cons**: Limited customization compared to React/Vue, server-side rendering only

## Backend Architecture
The application follows a **service-oriented architecture** with separation of concerns:
- `kalshi_service.py` handles all Kalshi API interactions with normalization layer
- `openai_service.py` manages AI analysis generation
- `app.py` serves as the presentation layer and orchestrator

### Market Normalization Layer
The `KalshiService` class includes a comprehensive normalization pipeline that transforms raw API data:

**Category Mapping**:
- Parses event ticker pattern: `KXNFL{TYPE}-{DATE}{TEAM1}{TEAM2}`
- Maps TYPE codes to categories: GAME→"Games", PASSYDS→"Passing Yards", RSHYDS→"Rushing Yards", etc.
- Handles multivariate markets as "Same Game Parlays"

**Team Name Resolution**:
- Includes complete NFL team code dictionary (MIN→"Minnesota Vikings", LAC→"Los Angeles Chargers", etc.)
- Parses team codes by scanning from end of ticker to handle 2-3 letter codes correctly
- Expands abbreviated team names in API titles ("Los Angeles C" → "Los Angeles Chargers")

**Display Name Generation**:
- Prefers API title/subtitle when available
- Applies team abbreviation expansion to multivariate market titles
- Fallback ticker parsing for player prop markets

**Probability & Volume Calculation**:
- Probability: uses yes_bid/100 (cents to decimal), fallback chain: yes_bid → last_price → mid_price
- Volume: prefers `volume` field, fallback to `volume_24h`, then `liquidity`

**Market Pairing & Combination**:
- Groups markets by `event_ticker` to identify opposing contracts
- Combines paired markets using `combine_market_pair()` method
- Stores both team contracts as `away_contract` and `home_contract`
- Calculates probabilities for both teams with fallback chain
- Uses maximum volume from both contracts

**Output Fields Added to Combined Markets**:
- `category`: High-level category name (e.g., "Games")
- `matchup`: Team matchup (e.g., "Minnesota Vikings @ Los Angeles Chargers")
- `display_name`: Game title from API
- `away_team`, `home_team`: Full team names
- `away_ticker`, `home_ticker`: Individual contract tickers
- `away_probability`, `home_probability`: Win probabilities for each team
- `away_probability_pct`, `home_probability_pct`: Formatted percentage strings
- `display_volume`: Combined volume
- `away_contract`, `home_contract`: Full contract data for both teams
- `market_type_code`: Raw market type for reference

## Pagination Implementation
The app implements **true server-side cursor-based pagination**:
- Fetches fresh data from Kalshi API for each page navigation using `series_ticker=KXNFLGAME`
- Stores cursors in session state (`page_cursors` list)
- Returns all game outcome markets (no client-side filtering needed)
- Next/Previous buttons trigger new API calls with appropriate cursors
- Consistent page sizes since all results are game markets

## Data Visualization
**Plotly** is used for interactive charts and graphs (imported in `app.py`). This was chosen over simpler charting libraries to provide rich, interactive visualizations of market data including price movements, volume, and probability distributions.

**Alternatives considered**: Matplotlib (less interactive), Altair (simpler but less flexible)

## AI Integration
The application uses **OpenAI's GPT-5** (latest model as of August 2025) to generate market analysis briefs. The `OpenAIService` class:
- Constructs detailed prompts with market data
- Formats probability implications from bid prices
- Generates concise 3-4 sentence analyses
- **GPT-5 Configuration**: Uses `max_completion_tokens=5000` to account for reasoning tokens (GPT-5 is a reasoning model that consumes tokens for internal reasoning before generating output)
- **Reasoning effort**: Set to "low" for simple analysis tasks to reduce token overhead
- **Debug logging**: Tracks API responses (finish_reason, refusal, content, usage) for troubleshooting

The AI brief covers market sentiment, probability analysis, and contextual insights to help users make informed decisions.

## Data Flow
1. User searches/browses markets → Kalshi API call with `series_ticker=KXNFLGAME` and cursor-based pagination
2. Game outcome markets returned from API (paired contracts for each game)
3. Markets grouped by `event_ticker` to identify pairs
4. Paired markets combined through `KalshiService.combine_market_pair()`
5. Combined markets grouped into nested structure: {category: {matchup: [combined_markets]}}
6. Displayed with Category → Matchup → Combined Markets hierarchy (one row per game)
7. User selects game → Detail page shows both teams with radio button selector
8. User selects team → Contract data loaded for chosen team
9. OpenAI generates analysis for selected contract
10. Results displayed with Plotly visualizations

**Note**: The application currently operates in read-only mode without user authentication. Future enhancements may include authenticated trading capabilities.

# Known Limitations & Behavior Notes
- Client-side search only filters current page results (not across all pages)
- Some markets may lack historical price data (handled gracefully with info messages)
- OpenAI API quota limitations may prevent AI brief generation (displays error message)
- Markets with no active bids show 0% probability and $0 volume (expected behavior, not a bug)
- App displays **only game outcome contracts** - no player props, parlays, or other market types
- **Each game displays as one combined row** - API returns 2 contracts per game (one per team) which are merged in the UI
- Probabilities may not sum exactly to 100% due to bid-ask spreads and market inefficiencies
